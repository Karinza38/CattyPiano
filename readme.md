How to start developing
----

This project uses `nextjs` framework and `pnpm` as the package manager.

To start developing, first check if there is `node` on your computer,
run `node -v` to check if it can print the version.

If not, please search `nodejs` and download a node
with version greater or equal to `v18.18.0`.

Use `npm install -g pnpm` to install `pnpm`.
After installing `pnpm`, use `pnpm i` under this project.

Finally, you could launch it by `npm run dev`,
this will allow you to check how your page looks like when you are developing.

After that, please create a `.gitignore` file in the root of the project.
The file should contain these:

```
.gitignore

node_modules/
.next/
```

To avoid the conflict of `.gitignore`, it is suggested for you to create your own.
